            <!-- <p> <strong>DESCRIPTION </strong> </p>
        <p>Slide 1: How It All Began — key foundations (Turing’s test, Unimate, ELIZA) and the coinage of “artificial intelligence.”
        </br>
            Slide 2: AI Winters and the Rise of Deep Learning (1973–2023) — causes of winters (overpromising, compute limits, market collapse),</br>and the later resurgence through neural networks and modern tooling.
        </br>   
            Each milestone includes a concise “why it mattered” to keep the story decision-useful for non-experts..</p> -->
            <p> <strong>OBJECTIVE </strong> </p>
            <p> To synthesize insights from course readings and two self‑assessments (AI/ML Integration Leadership
                Skills and Change Management Skills),</br>articulate my strengths and growth areas, and propose
                practical revisions to improve the assessment tools.
            </p>
            <p><strong>PROCESS</strong></p>
            <p>1. Read the assigned articles on change leadership and change‑management skills.
                </br>
                2. Prioritized to a minimal narrative (foundations → winters → resurgence).
                </br>
                3. Mapped results into top strengths and growth areas across AI/ML leadership and change management.
                </br>
                4. Wrote a discussion post connecting readings to my results and recommending tool revisions.
                </br>
                5. Incorporated peer‑discussion feedback and distilled the “bottom line” for ongoing development.
