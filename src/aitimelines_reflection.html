                   <p><strong><em>Customization for the Audience</em></strong> </p>
                   <p> I designed the timeline for non-experts who need fast context: decade markers, short “why it mattered” captions, and a clear flow from foundational milestones → AI winters → deep-learning resurgence.</p>
                   <p> <strong><em>Lessons Learned</em></strong></p>
                   <p>Progress is best explained by enablers (compute, data, algorithms), not dates alone. Capturing “bridge” milestones between winters and modern LLMs—especially mainstream deployments—helps stakeholders see how research turns into real products and expectations.</p>
                   <p><strong><em>Feedback & Revisions</em></strong></p>
                   <p>I initially under-covered 2006–2022. Based on feedback, I added IBM Watson (2011) and Apple Siri (2011) to represent public, high-visibility AI deployments that bridged academic advances and mass adoption. These additions clarify the narrative arc from deep-learning breakthroughs to consumer/enterprise impact, and they prevent a false jump from “winter” directly to 2022–2023 systems. I also tightened captions for cause→effect, improved spacing, and kept references in a companion note for readability.  </p>
                   <p><strong><em>Addressing Prior Portfolio Feedback</em></strong> </p>
                   <p>I missed adding a formal reflection to my Artifact 1 page. Per my professor’s guidance, I have now included that reflection and used this second artifact to establish a consistent pattern: every artifact will ship with Customization for the Audience, Lessons Learned, and Feedback & Revisions so the portfolio clearly shows process, growth, and responsiveness to feedback.</p>
