           <p> <strong>OBJECTIVE </strong> </p>
            <p> Demonstrate critical reflection across disciplines (theology, cognitive science, leadership, communication, AI)<br/> and clearly state a personal stance on<br/> machine vs. human reasoning, showing how faith convictions inform professional practice.
            </p>
            <p><strong>PROCESS</strong></p>
            <p>1.1 – Capacity to Learn & Imago Dei: Studied neuroplasticity and Scripture (Gen 1:27; Ps 139:13–14; Eph 2:10; Isa 40:28; Rev 4:11)<br/> to ground the claim that humans are made to learn, create, and reason.
                </br>
            </br>
                2.1 – Unique Creation & Stewardship: Distilled themes of God-given gifts, service-oriented leadership,<br/> and seeking wisdom beyond human understanding.
                </br>
            </br>
                3.1 – Adaptive Leadership: Drew lessons from Moses (dependence on God when underqualified) and Esther (courage and timing),<br/> applying them to leading through uncertainty.
                </br>
            </br>
                4.1 – Clarity in Communication: Analyzed how unclear messaging fragments teams; adopted practices<br/> (purpose - first framing, feedback loops, written follow-ups) as a spiritual discipline of clarity.
                </br>
            </br>
                <em>Synthesized a human–machine reasoning map (what AI can approximate vs. where irreducibly human dimensions - <br/>moral agency, covenantal responsibility, meaning-making, worship, conscience—remain).</em>
            </p>
            <p> <strong>TOOLS & TECHNOLOGIES USED
                </strong></p>
            <p>scripture references (NIV), citation notes; GitHub Pages/Google Sites for portfolio publishing.</br>
                Writing/Editing: Word

            <p><strong> VALUE PROPOSITION
                </strong></p>
            <p> Shows I can bridge faith, science, and technology to guide practice: setting realistic expectations for AI, framing human strengths<br/>
                 (moral discernment, purpose, empathy), and translating them into day-to-day leadership and communication habits.
